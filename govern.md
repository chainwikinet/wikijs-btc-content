## 1-Hour Voting Period

from Discord discussions on 2022-08-17:

> we want a short voting period so if unexpected problems arise we have the option to address them via proposal without waiting a full 24 hours.
just a launch safety thing
after things stabilize, i personally would advocate for shifting to a normal length window
im hoping we move to 24 hour voting period in 2 days.
give LM 24 hours to make sure no critical issues
