# Token Distribution

Canto has a native token, CANTO, which is used to pay fees and can be staked to secure the network.

## Total Supply

via [the launch announcement on Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/0x4CeD9817cAD891aEFfbF5Fb7DcB6f3c6aEBd4228/6UtxzGXsyCt6onAZjqwinAlQXhmq41Ow9o5SvPRkNKo):

>At genesis, 1B tokens were minted. The tokens will be distributed in the following manner:
> - Contributors: 13.0%
> - Settlers of Canto: 2%
> - Future Grants: 5%
> - Medium-Term Liquidity Mining: 35%
> - Long-Term Liquidity Mining: 45%
>
> Tokens not yet distributed (Grants and Future Liquidity Mining) will be kept in the 
> community pool.

Medium-Term liquidity incentives will be distributed over the first six months after launch; Long-Term incentives will be distributed over some number of years (10?).

## Airdrop

If you didn't get the airdrop and think you should have, fill out the form in [the #airdrop-form Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/993968517906960445/1009274306133508147) and wait (patiently!) for a response: https://forms.gle/LR16PdAPF6ox1csy8


# Bridging

The canonical bridge for Canto is the Gravity Bridge Chain, an independent, sovereign Cosmos zone that operates a bridge between Cosmos chains and Ethereum.

- use the GBC bridge: 
- read more about GBC: 

Canto also supports assets from other Cosmos chains; these assets can be bridged to Canto using the native Cosmos IBC bridge.

> Assets bridged to Canto by IBC can only be used in Canto EVM applications by converting them into Canto ERC-20 tokens.  Canto governance controls the list of supported tokens that can be converted.  For example, see [governance proposal #4 to map Canto ERC-20 tokens for Cosmos Hub's ATOM token](https://governance.canto.io/).
